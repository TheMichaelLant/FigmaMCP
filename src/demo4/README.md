given this auth form, i want you to build it, although in the real world we would have the UI component lib for you to work on, but in this case just do your best
make sure all components are effectively separated into component files,
make sure we are using props to communicate between parent to child,
should have a parent component that contains all the inner components,
make it responsive, this is a single column design across all width, but make sure we are preserving some usable paddings, and ensure there is a container for max width
put it in another directory called demo 4, and add it to "app.tsx" file with a link to it
just use react and tailwind to style it, as close as you can with the layout
